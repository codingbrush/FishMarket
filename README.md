## Background
This was supposed to be an app for a fish farm to sell their products. The client decided to go old school with the sales part so this POS never got used ðŸ˜•. 
It sold according to weight(kg) and there was a discount applied for specified customers or if the weight of the items to be sold exceeded 10kg.

Try it out and see if it fits your needs.ðŸ‘Œ
